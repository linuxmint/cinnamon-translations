# Someone needs to check (a) occurrences of key (if GConf, allwedd;
# if most other things, bysell); (b) occurrences of application(s)
# rhaglennu or the other one I now can't put my finger on?
#
# I think I've caught most of the erroneous "bysell"s. Funnily enough, I
# changed several occurrences of "bysell" to "allwedd" (GConf context) and
# several occurrences of "allwedd" to "bysell" (keyboard context). Also
# replaced "gweithredu" with "cymhwyso" (for "apply") and "wynebfath" with
# "ffont". I can believe that "wynebfath" is a better word, but I thought it
# would be better to be consistently wrong for now.
